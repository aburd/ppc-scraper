This is a tester for Servcorp Japan's sites using casperjs.
for more info on casperjs and it's parent headless browser phantomjs please go to:

Of use to you would probably be in the ppc-results.js file which searches a term on Google and returns the results in a color coded fashion.

The other file does a bunch of webform testing.
